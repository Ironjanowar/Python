This repo contains things that I've been doing in Python

* 1. Contains
** Challenges
Little solved problems usually from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/][reddit]]
** TalkingBot
The first bot I've ever did was kind of like this one but writed in C. This one is obviously in Python.
It answers in a silly way to all the things you tell it.

* 2. Usage
Take any .py and run it with:

python [name].py
